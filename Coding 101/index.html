   <h1>Pokemon</h1> <p class="wrap-text"> <b>Pokemon</b> is a card game that uses pokemon cards to play. The pokemon world is divided into seven different regions. The regions are   <i>Kanto, Jhoto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, And Alola.  </i>  <span > All the regions have unique pokemon, </span> and you'll be learning about those pokemon later. For now, let's talk about pokemon types. The types are:<u> grass, fire, water, electric, ghost, fighting, fairy, flying, rock, ground, normal, bug, psychic, dark, dragon, steel, ice, and poison.</u> Pokemon also have type advantage. For example, a grass type would get scorched against a fire type, but a water type would douse that pokemon's flame. However, that water type would act like a sprinkler on a grass type. 
   
   Since I promised we'd learn more about the pokemon regions, let's get right into it. Kanto is the first released region. It houses the original 151 pokemon, which is pretty impressive. However, it did not have any fairy types! It turns out, they hadn't been released yet. It also doesn't have any dark types.

   	Johto isn't far from Kanto, and added and expanded to the pokemon world. It houses the <i> Johto Silver Conference </i>, a giant competition that can only be entered if you have Gym Badges {which are earned by defeating powerful trainers known as Gym Leaders} From all of Johto- it's really hard to enter.

  	 Up next is Hoenn. Hoenn is a region that has even more gym leaders! You didn't think I'd stopped talking about them, did you? It has more new pokemon, including Treecko, Grovyle, and Sceptile. It also has new Legendary Pokemon. 
   	 They include Rayquaza, Groudon, and Kyogre. Hoenn kicks things up a notch! 
      
      We also have Sinnoh. Sinnoh is rich in legendary pokemon! Some of it's best known legendary pokemon are Dialga and Palkia, the rulers of time and space. Some other well-known rarities are the trio of lake guardians. Their names are Uxie, the being of knowledge, Mesprit, the being of emotion, and one of my personal favorites, Azelf, the being of willpower. 

      Next up is Unova. Unova is home to relatively rare pokemon such as rufflet and braviary. But Beware! Several criminal gangs inhabit Unova. All of them are nasty Pokemon theives. The most active of them is Team Plasma. They use inside manipulation to acheive their means. Unova is a bright region, but it has some downsides. Did you know that pikachu are rare there? It's weird but true!

      Then, we have the Kalos region. It's well known for it's powerful pokemon and freindly trainers. Maybe that's why it's shaped like a star! Kalos is divided into three sections. Central kalos is connected by a series of canals and waterways. It's perfect for a boat ride! There's also the added bonus that you have acess to all the best shops! Coastal Kalos is exactly what it sounds like-it's a beach! Coastal Kalos may be a vacation spot, but that doesn't drop it's quality for pokemon! Some rare pokemon like Coastal Kalos. In fact, You may be lucky enough to spot the legendary Articuno! Last up is the mountainous part of Kalos. These beautiful mountains house a variety of pokemon, and those pokemon are known for their strength and stamina. These include steel, ground, and rock types. All of them can easily hold their own in a fight.
