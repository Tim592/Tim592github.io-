       Pokemon <br/> Beyblade
         <strong> These are games. </strong>
            <u> Pokemon is a card game. Beyblade is a game that uses small tops.</u> <i> Neither are hard to play, but they both have rules. </i>  

            <h1>     These are the rules for beyblade       </h1>

     <h3>Load your top (or bey) into a launcher. Launch your bey. The beys will hit each other several times.</h3> 

     <h5>How to win: If your bey spins for longer than your opponent's it is a survivor finish. You get one point. If you knock your opponent's bey out of the stadium or into one of the "pockets" (small depressions in the stadium) it is a "ring out finish." You get one point. If your opponent's bey bursts in battle, it is a "burst finish!" You get two points. Matches are often done first to two points, so a burst finish usually guarantees a win. If any of these happen simaltaneously, it is a draw. No points are awarded. Let's talk about "Burst Priority". Remember when we talked about how to win? Burst priority adds to that. Here's an example. Let's say your bey had been hit hard and was flying through the air, but had not touched the ground yet. Then your opponents bey bursts! Burst priority kicks in, and you win with a burst finish. Do you get the idea? Brilliant!  </h5> <hr> Pokemon is a card game that uses pokemon cards to win. <mark>When a pokemon "attacks" you put small cardboard "damage counters" on your opponent's pokemon to keep track of how much damage is on it.</mark> When a pokemon takes damage equal to or greater than it's "hit point maximum" it is knocked out. Put the card in your discard pile.<p> When a pokemon is knocked out, the person that knocked it out takes a "prize card". When someone takes all six of their prize cards, the game is over. That person wins. <small> Remember this. It is very important.</small>

      <ol> <li> When you evolve a pokemon, put a special evolution card on top. That pokemon cannot evolve again this turn. However, you can also evolve a  different pokemon then the one you just evolved.</li> </ol> <ul> <li> Evolution is important. If you get it wrong, you could lose in one shot. It's happened to me before...</li> </ol>
